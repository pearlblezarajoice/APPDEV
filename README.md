**I love the WEDNESDAY series in Netflix.**
It is about a girl having this *superficial vision* that allows her to see the future.
1. In her vision she can see this monster killing a lot of people randomly.
2. She's finding who's this monster in her vision. 
3. Then, she found out that the master of the monster is one of the teachers in their school.
4. Then, it turns out that the monster is the boy that she loved.
